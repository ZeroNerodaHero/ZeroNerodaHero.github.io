A girl is caught in the Bosian Civil War. She is stuck and has to survive on 
Fruit Cups air dropped by the Americans. In America, fruit cups might be worth
a few dimes; however this is Bosnia. A fruit cup is worth $10 on the black market.
Luckly, the girl gets a supply drop of 100 cups right in front of babushka's house.

Rules:
The girl falls victim to the local gambler. She can choose to how much to gamble
(wager) and the risk. If the graph's y value is higher than the risk, she wins and 
gains an amount equal to risk. For example, if she wagers 1 cup and has a risk of 1, she earns 1 cups.
No matter what, if she loses, she loses the wager.

Calculation(dynamic):

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Win </th>
        <th> Loss </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class = "WinCnt"> </td>
        <td class = "LossCnt"> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
(It's just a tree diagram: win/loss).

Expected Value(<span class = "EValue"></span>) = 
<span class="LossCnt"></span>/360 x (-<span class="wagercnt"></span>) 
+ 
<span class="WinCnt"></span>/360 x <span class="wagercnt2"></span>

Distribution(<span class = "distrb"></span>) = 
(-<span class="wagercnt"></span> - <span class="EValue></span>)^2 x
<span class="LossCnt"></span>/360
+
(<span class="wagercnt2"></span> - <span class="EValue></span>)^2 x
<span class="WinCnt"></span>/360
