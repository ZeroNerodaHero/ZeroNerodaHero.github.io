      	   <p><mark> Hello. This is a dum site I made and probably will not be helpful at all to you understanding of me.<br>
            I also have nothing to write because I don't know what the point of this website is even. <br>
            I fucking hate the background of the website because I have to mark everything. In order to see things <br>
            I might just make everything white and without any CSS. <br>

            <br>Update 8/03/20: I have no idea what my code even is. I also don't even know how to use HTML.

            <br><br>

            I have nothing else to say, so this could just be my good toddpost page<br><br>
