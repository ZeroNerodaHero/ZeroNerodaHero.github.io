            I fucked up on my exam and got like 69%(this is real btw). I am rewriting the right answers. So question 1 was 
            basically about on \(S_4\) what are all the even permuations. We can reduce the problem down to finding all
            unique combination of two perms applied an even amount of times. We can only apply it zero, twice, or six times.
            For sanity check, we know there exists a total of \(4!=24\) combinations, 
            but only half or \(12\) combinations.
            \[
                Even(S_4) = \{1\}\cup\{(12)(13),(12)(14),(13)(12),(13)(14),(14)(12),(14)(13)\}\cup\{(12)(34),(13)(24),(14)(23)\}
            \]
            I wrote it in union because some of them 
            \[
            \langle \underline{x} | H | \underline{x}\rangle+...(\text{higher order terms})\ > 0
            \]
            This is true when H is positive definite by applying the same argument. If we cannot confirm either case(ie semi-definite), 
            it would depend on the higher order terms. Pretty cool.
